#### Objects:

####  DOMContentLoaded:
* The DOMContentLoaded event fires when the HTML document has been completely parsed without waiting for images and stylesheets to finish loading, and all deferred scripts (<script defer src="â€¦"> and <script type="module">) have downloaded and executed. It doesn't wait for other things like images, subframes, and async scripts to finish loading.
